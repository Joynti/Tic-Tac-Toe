# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is a simple web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game developed using HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript

## How to Play
1. Open the index.html file in any web browser.
2. Players take turns clicking on the boxes to place either an "X" or an "O".
3. The game will automatically check for a winner after each turn.
4. If a player aligns three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal, a winner message is displayed.
5. If all the boxes are filled and no winner is found, the game declares a draw.
